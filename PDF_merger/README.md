Hi, welcome to my first ever folder I upload to the "The Complete Python Developer" course. I know it's basic and unorganized but I promise I will be updating it untill I consider it's presentable.

To use this program:
1) To use this set of python files in order first you need to have only the [dummy.pdf, twopage.pdf] files.
2) Using the command prompt, use the tilter.py file. This should create the rotated_page.pdf file.
3) Once you have the rotated_page.pdf file, type the following line of code in the cmd:

    python3 pdf_conviner.py dummy.pdf twopage.pdf rotated_page.pdf

This should create the file super.pdf file.

I know it's rudymental and it's not well organized but I'm proud of it as it's one of my first ever projects and I had to find a way to make it work because of two reasons:
    1) The PyPDF2 library was updated since the course was made so a lot of functions were changed.
    2) Not even pycharm and many other IA tools suggested the updated lines of code so I had to update them reading the error messages that the cmd gave me back.

As promised I will update this untill it's good enough, thanks for going through this readme file and checking my depository :)
