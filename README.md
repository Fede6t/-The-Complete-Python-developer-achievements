Hi, this is a repository I made to upload and record all the achievements I manage to get. 
Sometimes it'll be something I learned thanks to the course and in some cases, like the pdf_merger one, it'll be one in which I had to learn by myself how to improvise a solution.

At first glance this projects will be very unorganized and rudymental but as I learn more about python I will come back and update the files to improve them untill I believe they are good enough.

In any case, thank you for stopping by. Hope you have a great day :)
